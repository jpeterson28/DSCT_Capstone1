## Problem and Client
The city of Phoenix, AZ is the 5th largest city in the United States. Over the last 6 years the population of Phoenix has increased. With the increase in population there is the potential for an increase in crime. This poses the question: 1) Does it make sense for the city of Phoenix to hire more police officers to support the population increase?; 2) Can we use historical data crime data to determine where crime hot spots will be to allocate resources more efficiently and not have to hire new officers? The clients for this project is the Phoenix Police department and City of Phoenix.. They can use the findings to allocate resources(officers, patrols routes, etc.), make budgetary decisions and develop community outreach programs to prevent crime. 

## Data
The city of Phoenix publishes an updated crime incident list at 11am daily (https://phoenixopendata.com/dataset/crime-data).  The list contains crime incident data from November 1st, 2015 forward through 7 days prior to today's posting date. The data provided  includes; Date/Time of Incident, UCR crime type, Block Address, Zip code and Premise Type. In addition, I will append demographic data for Phoenix to help answer our question which is also provided by the city of Phoenix. 

## Approach and Deliverables
The approach will be to use the historical crime data to show how accurately the type of crime can be predicted.  Multiple machine learning technique will be utilized to determine which provides the most accurate prediction. The deliverables for this project will be all the code, a report detailing the work completed and a slide deck providing the story and answers.
